		<h2> # 1 </h2>
		<p> My cat would be happy with his eyes closed purring and layed down my side and then suddenly look in the direction of the corner of the room with his eyes completely open. When I look there's nothing there. It's scary!</p>

		<p> My dog goes nuts over the song 'Happy Birthday'. She barks and runs around and jump on us. We have no idea why. If there is a video with the song, she runs in and barks. If we sing it over Skype, same reaction.
   She won't get excited for other cheering, or clapping or singing, like when we watched sports, or were just generally loud and excited. She doesn't go nuts for other birthday songs (like that 'happy happy birthday'). Just 'Happy Birthday'.</p>

		<p> Not sure if this counts but my snake falls off of everything. Put him around your neck he falls off. He falls while trying to climb up or down my chair, desk, and always plops off my bed if I am not watching him. He will even get excited smelling something so he will point his head straight up and extend his body up until he falls backwards belly up. Will also do this while swallowing his food.</p>

		<h2> # 4 </h2>
		<p> My dog likes to sit in the bathtub during the summer, most likely because it's cooler than the floor or her bed. Totally harmless unless you're going to the bathroom in the middle of the night and think there's a killer in your shower.</p>

			<p> My parrot is obsessed with ears. He will happily spend 15-20 minutes delicately nibbling on the rim of my ear, carefully scraping his beak around the inside, and licking all over. Last time I saw my doctor for a physical and she got to the otoscope part of the exam, she exclaimed, "Wow, your ears are remarkably clean!" Gee, I wonder why...</p>

				<h2> # 6 </h2>
				<p> My dog smiles whenever he wants something. He started showing his teeth when he got excited to see us after long periods of times (i.e. vacations) and we would say "What a pretty smile!" He made the connection to the word and now will do it on command and pretty much whenever he wants our food. Kind of like a "hey look I'm smiling, I'm pretty!" Some people probably think it's bad that he does it because he's technically showing his teeth, but you can tell it's not aggressive or in a bad way. I think it's hilarious.</p>

					<p> My cat likes to shower with me. He will sit and drink the water as it runs until i use shower gel, then he will sit on the edge silently judging me for contaminating our lord water.</p>

						<h2> # 8 </h2>
						<p> My dachshund loves carrots more than anything in the world. When we are talking about them we have to say 'orange taproot' because he gets way too excited.</p>
